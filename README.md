# ANN Modules for Hand Gesture Recognition

This repository contains code for Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modules trained on the **Jester dataset** for hand gesture recognition. The project focuses on accurate recognition of gestures using RGB video inputs.

## Features

- Preprocessing scripts for the Jester dataset
- ANN model training and evaluation
- Configurable hyperparameters for model optimization
- Example usage for inference on new data

## Dataset

The [Jester dataset](https://20bn.com/datasets/jester) is used for training and evaluation. It contains 12-fps videos of various hand gestures. Ensure the dataset is downloaded and organized before running the scripts.
